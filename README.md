# Task Manager App
This is a Mobile app project to remotely register your tasks and complete them by taking an instant picture.
It was developed as a way to learn more about KMM (Kotlin Multiplatform Mobile) with remote integration by making calls to a [backend service](https://github.com/gmfonseca/task-manager-backend).

NOTE: The iOS part is still in progress
